    <h1>Live ‚ô• Laugh ‚ô• Love</h1>
    <h2>You haven't experienced life, until you have met these guys...</h2>

    <p>
      Introducing, these 2 pieces of art, hand crafted by a higher power. These
      amazing perfect tiny bundles of joy were created in 2020. Though this is
      highly debated for the eldest of the 2, as it is clear he has lived many
      lives before this one.
    </p>
    <h3>This is Chico</h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z4Lqw9c.png" alt="Chico" />
    <p>
      Chico was born on the 15th of March, 2020. Some may call him the runt of
      the litter, others argue you cannot rush perfection.
      <br />
      <br />
      Still only 800g as a 6 month old, Chico decided to not waste all this
      growing energy on his body, but on his brain. With a such a high
      intellegence, also comes with a few burdens. He has a strong personality,
      can be stubborn and does not accept people without trust. He can be a
      little judgemental, to be honest. But with that, any affection is so much
      more powerful.
      <br />
      <br />
      His existance has been celebrated by many, with artworks created in his
      honour.
    </p>

    <h4>This is Chimichurri</h4>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q2Jg92m.png" alt="Chimi" />
    <p>
      Chimi was born on the 9th of November, 2020. Having the biggest glow up of
      the 2, Chimi resembled a tiny Husky.
      <br />
      <br />
      As many of the beauties before her, Demi Moore, Beyonce, Taylor Swift to
      name a few, Chimi needed some time to evolve into the beautiful butterfly
      she is today. Now standing tall with her long legs and blond locks, Chimi
      is a ball of energy, strong and independant. With a bright personality,
      she is extremely extroverted and loves everyone she meets! She is
      protective of her more introverted brother, and will be the first to
      assess and greet strangers.
      <br />
      <br />
      As the newest member for the family, she may have less artworks, but her
      beauty is well known.
